    Hi,

    I installed polly with clang/llvm 3.4 and it speed up 6 times than clang
    -O3 for matmul.c came from polly source example code.
    But for the covariance.c of polybench-c-3.2 I cannot get any improvement in
    speed.
    I use clang -O3 -mllvm -polly on both matmul.c and covariance.c.
    Can someone helps me?


You currently need a couple of flags:

polybench-c-3.2$ polly-clang -O3 datamining/covariance/covariance.c utilities/polybench.c -I utilities/  -DPOLYBENCH_TIME -mllvm -polly-ignore-aliasing -DPOLYBENCH_USE_SCALAR_LB
polybench-c-3.2$ ./a.out
5.276531
polybench-c-3.2$ polly-clang -O3 datamining/covariance/covariance.c utilities/polybench.c -I utilities/  -DPOLYBENCH_TIME -mllvm -polly-ignore-aliasing -DPOLYBENCH_USE_SCALAR_LB -mllvm -polly
polybench-c-3.2$ ./a.out
0.472491

-polly-ignore-aliasing:

We still miss run-time alias checks, so you need to declare that no aliasing will happen

-DPOLYBENCH_USE_SCALAR_LB

Otherwise, polybench will generate a mix of scalar and parametric loop bounds. We can work with that, but the generated code still needs some
tuning.

Let me know if you can reproduce the results.

Cheers,
Tobias
