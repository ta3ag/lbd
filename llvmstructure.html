<h3>Replace ldi instruction by addiu instruction<a class="headerlink" href="#replace-ldi-instruction-by-addiu-instruction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have recognized the ldi instruction is a bad design and replace it with mips
instruction addiu.
The reason we replace ldi with addiu is that ldi use only one register even
though ldi is L type format and has two registers, as <a class="reference internal" href="#llvmstructure-f4"><em>Cpu0 ldi instruction</em></a>.
Mips addiu which allow programmer to do load constant to register like ldi,
and add constant to a register. So, it&#8217;s powerful and fully contains the ldi
ability.
These two instructions format as <a class="reference internal" href="#llvmstructure-f4"><em>Cpu0 ldi instruction</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#llvmstructure-f5"><em>Mips addiu instruction format</em></a>.</p>

<div class="figure align-center" id="llvmstructure-f5">
<img alt="_images/52.png" src="_images/52.png" />
<p class="caption">Mips addiu instruction format</p>
</div>
<p>From <a class="reference internal" href="#llvmstructure-f4"><em>Cpu0 ldi instruction</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#llvmstructure-f5"><em>Mips addiu instruction format</em></a>, you can find ldi $Ra,
5 can be replaced by addiu $Ra, $zero, 5.
And more, addiu can do addiu $Ra, $Rb, 5 which add $Rb and 5 then save to $Ra,
but ldi cannot.
As a cpu design, it&#8217;s common to redesign CPU instruction when find a better
solution during design the compiler backend for that CPU.
So, we add addiu instruction to cpu0.
The cpu0 is my brother&#8217;s work, I will find time to talk with him.</p>

<h2>LLVM structure<a class="headerlink" href="#llvm-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Following came from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html">AOSA</a>.</p>
<p>The most popular design for a traditional static compiler (like most C
compilers) is the three phase design whose major components are the front end,
the optimizer and the back end (<a class="reference internal" href="#llvmstructure-f6"><em>Tree major components of a Three Phase Compiler</em></a>).
The front end parses source code, checking it for errors, and builds a
language-specific Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the input code.
The AST is optionally converted to a new representation for optimization, and
the optimizer and back end are run on the code.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="llvmstructure-f6">
<img alt="_images/62.png" src="_images/62.png" />
<p class="caption">Tree major components of a Three Phase Compiler</p>
</div>
<p>The optimizer is responsible for doing a broad variety of transformations to
try to improve the code&#8217;s running time, such as eliminating redundant
computations, and is usually more or less independent of language and target.
The back end (also known as the code generator) then maps the code onto the
target instruction set.
In addition to making correct code, it is responsible for generating good code
that takes advantage of unusual features of the supported architecture.
Common parts of a compiler back end include instruction selection, register
allocation, and instruction scheduling.</p>
<p>This model applies equally well to interpreters and JIT compilers.
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is also an implementation of this model, which
uses Java bytecode as the interface between the front end and optimizer.</p>
<p>The most important win of this classical design comes when a compiler decides
to support multiple source languages or target architectures.
If the compiler uses a common code representation in its optimizer, then a
front end can be written for any language that can compile to it, and a back
end can be written for any target that can compile from it, as shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#llvmstructure-f7"><em>Retargetablity</em></a>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="llvmstructure-f7">
<img alt="_images/72.png" src="_images/72.png" />
<p class="caption">Retargetablity</p>
</div>
<p>With this design, porting the compiler to support a new source language (e.g.,
Algol or BASIC) requires implementing a new front end, but the existing
optimizer and back end can be reused.
If these parts weren&#8217;t separated, implementing a new source language would
require starting over from scratch, so supporting N targets and M source
languages would need N*M compilers.</p>
<p>Another advantage of the three-phase design (which follows directly from
retargetability) is that the compiler serves a broader set of programmers than
it would if it only supported one source language and one target.
For an open source project, this means that there is a larger community of
potential contributors to draw from, which naturally leads to more enhancements
and improvements to the compiler.
This is the reason why open source compilers that serve many communities (like
GCC) tend to generate better optimized machine code than narrower compilers
like FreePASCAL.
This isn&#8217;t the case for proprietary compilers, whose quality is directly
related to the project&#8217;s budget.
For example, the Intel ICC Compiler is widely known for the quality of code it
generates, even though it serves a narrow audience.</p>
<p>A final major win of the three-phase design is that the skills required to
implement a front end are different than those required for the optimizer and
back end.
Separating these makes it easier for a &#8220;front-end person&#8221; to enhance and
maintain their part of the compiler.
While this is a social issue, not a technical one, it matters a lot in
practice, particularly for open source projects that want to reduce the barrier
to contributing as much as possible.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of its design is the LLVM Intermediate Representation
(IR), which is the form it uses to represent code in the compiler.
LLVM IR is designed to host mid-level analyses and transformations that you
find in the optimizer section of a compiler.
It was designed with many specific goals in mind, including supporting
lightweight runtime optimizations, cross-function/interprocedural
optimizations, whole program analysis, and aggressive restructuring
transformations, etc.
The most important aspect of it, though, is that it is itself defined as a
first class language with well-defined semantics.
To make this concrete, here is a simple example of a .ll file:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><pre>define i32 @add1(i32 %a, i32 %b) {
entry:
  %tmp1 = add i32 %a, %b
  ret i32 %tmp1
}
define i32 @add2(i32 %a, i32 %b) {
entry:
  %tmp1 = icmp eq i32 %a, 0
  br i1 %tmp1, label %done, label %recurse
recurse:
  %tmp2 = sub i32 %a, 1
  %tmp3 = add i32 %b, 1
  %tmp4 = call i32 @add2(i32 %tmp2, i32 %tmp3)
  ret i32 %tmp4
done:
  ret i32 %b
}
This LLVM IR corresponds to this C code, which provides two different ways to
 add integers:
unsigned add1(unsigned a, unsigned b) {
  return a+b;
}
// Perhaps not the most efficient way to add two numbers.
unsigned add2(unsigned a, unsigned b) {
  if (a == 0) return b;
  return add2(a-1, b+1);
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see from this example, LLVM IR is a low-level RISC-like virtual
instruction set.
Like a real RISC instruction set, it supports linear sequences of simple
instructions like add, subtract, compare, and branch.
These instructions are in three address form, which means that they take some
number of inputs and produce a result in a different register.
LLVM IR supports labels and generally looks like a weird form of assembly
language.</p>
<p>Unlike most RISC instruction sets, LLVM is strongly typed with a simple type
system (e.g., i32 is a 32-bit integer, i32** is a pointer to pointer to 32-bit
integer) and some details of the machine are abstracted away.
For example, the calling convention is abstracted through call and ret
instructions and explicit arguments.
Another significant difference from machine code is that the LLVM IR doesn&#8217;t
use a fixed set of named registers, it uses an infinite set of temporaries
named with a % character.</p>
<p>Beyond being implemented as a language, LLVM IR is actually defined in three
isomorphic forms: the textual format above, an in-memory data structure
inspected and modified by optimizations themselves, and an efficient and dense
on-disk binary &#8220;bitcode&#8221; format.
The LLVM Project also provides tools to convert the on-disk format from text to
binary: llvm-as assembles the textual .ll file into a .bc file containing the
bitcode goop and llvm-dis turns a .bc file into a .ll file.</p>
<p>The intermediate representation of a compiler is interesting because it can be
a &#8220;perfect world&#8221; for the compiler optimizer: unlike the front end and back end
of the compiler, the optimizer isn&#8217;t constrained by either a specific source
language or a specific target machine.
On the other hand, it has to serve both well: it has to be designed to be easy
for a front end to generate and be expressive enough to allow important
optimizations to be performed for real targets.</p>

<div class="section" id="target-description-td">
<h2>Target Description td<a class="headerlink" href="#target-description-td" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The &#8220;mix and match&#8221; approach allows target authors to choose what makes sense
for their architecture and permits a large amount of code reuse across
different targets.
This brings up another challenge: each shared component needs to be able to
reason about target specific properties in a generic way.
For example, a shared register allocator needs to know the register file of
each target and the constraints that exist between instructions and their
register operands.
LLVM&#8217;s solution to this is for each target to provide a target description
in a declarative domain-specific language (a set of .td files) processed by the
tblgen tool.
The (simplified) build process for the x86 target is shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#llvmstructure-f8"><em>Simplified x86 Target Definition</em></a>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="llvmstructure-f8">
<img alt="_images/82.png" src="_images/82.png" />
<p class="caption">Simplified x86 Target Definition</p>
</div>
<p>The different subsystems supported by the .td files allow target authors to
build up the different pieces of their target.
For example, the x86 back end defines a register class that holds all of its
32-bit registers named &#8220;GR32&#8221; (in the .td files, target specific definitions
are all caps) like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><pre>def GR32 : RegisterClass&lt;[i32], 32,
  [EAX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBX, EBP, ESP,
   R8D, R9D, R10D, R11D, R14D, R15D, R12D, R13D]&gt; { … }

tools.

<p>In C++ the data layout is declared by class. Declaration tells the variable
layout; definition allocates memory for the variable.
For example,</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Date</span> <span class="p">{</span>	<span class="c1">// declare Date</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">year</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">month</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">day</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span> 
<span class="n">Date</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="p">;</span>	<span class="c1">// define(instance) date</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Just like C++ class, the keyword “class” is used for declaring data structure
layout.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cpu0Reg&lt;string</span> <span class="pre">n&gt;</span></tt> declare a derived class from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Register&lt;n&gt;</span></tt> which is
declared by llvm already, where n is the argument of type string.
In addition to inherited from all the fields of Register class, Cpu0Reg add a
new field &#8220;Num&#8221; of type 4 bits.
Namespace is same with  C++ namespace.
“Def” is used by define(instance) a concrete variable.</p>
<p>As above, we define a ZERO register which type is Cpu0GPRReg, it&#8217;s field Num
is 0 (4 bits) and field n is “ZERO” (declared in Register class).
Note the use of “let” expressions to override values that are initially defined
in a superclass. For example, let Namespace = “Cpu0” in class Cpu0Reg, will
override Namespace declared in Register class.
The Cpu0RegisterInfo.td also define that CPURegs is a variable for type of
RegisterClass, where the RegisterClass is a llvm built-in class.
The type of RegisterClass is a set/group of Register, so CPURegs variable is
defined with a set of Register.</p>

<div class="section" id="target-registration">
<h2>Target Registration<a class="headerlink" href="#target-registration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You must also register your target with the TargetRegistry, which is what other
LLVM tools use to be able to lookup and use your target at runtime.
The TargetRegistry can be used directly, but for most targets there are helper
templates which should take care of the work for you.</p>
<p>All targets should declare a global Target object which is used to represent
the target during registration.
Then, in the target&#8217;s TargetInfo library, the target should define that object
and use the RegisterTarget template to register the target.
For example, the file TargetInfo/Cpu0TargetInfo.cpp register TheCpu0Target for
big endian and TheCpu0elTarget for little endian, as follows.</p>

<h2>Build libraries and td<a class="headerlink" href="#build-libraries-and-td" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The llvm3.1 source code is put in /usr/local/llvm/3.1/src and have llvm3.1
release-build in /usr/local/llvm/3.1/configure_release_build.
About how to build llvm, please refer <a class="reference external" href="http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html">http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html</a>.
We made a copy from /usr/local/llvm/3.1/src to
/usr/local/llvm/3.1.test/cpu0/1/src for working with my Cpu0 target back end.
Sub-directories src is for source code and cmake_debug_build is for debug
build directory.</p>
<p>Except directory src/lib/Target/Cpu0, there are a couple of files modified to
support cpu0 new Target.
Please check files in src_files_modify/src/.
You can search cpu0 without case sensitive to find the modified files by
command,</p>

<p>Now, run the cmake and make command to build td (the following cmake command is
for my setting),</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><pre>[Gamma@localhost cmake_debug_build]$ cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_

<p>After build, you can type command llc –version to find the cpu0 backend,</p>

<p>The “llc -version” can display “cpu0” and “cpu0el” message, because the
following code from file TargetInfo/Cpu0TargetInfo.cpp what in

<p>Now try to do llc command to compile input file ch3.cpp as follows,</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// ch3.cpp</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="p">}</span> 
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>First step, compile it with clang and get output ch3.bc as follows,</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><pre>[Gamma@localhost InputFiles]$ clang -c ch3.cpp -emit-llvm -o ch3.bc
</pre>
</div>
<p>Next step, transfer bitcode .bc to human readable text format as follows,</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><pre>[Gamma@localhost InputFiles]$ llvm-dis ch3.bc -o ch3.ll 

// ch3.ll
; ModuleID = 'ch3.bc' 
target datalayout = "e-p:64:64:64-i1:8:8-i8:8:8-i16:16:16-i32:32:32-i64:64:64-f3

define i32 @main() nounwind uwtable { 
  %1 = alloca i32, align 4 
  store i32 0, i32* %1 
  ret i32 0 
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>Now, compile ch3.bc into ch3.cpu0.s, we get the error message as follows,</p>
<div class="highlight-c++"><pre>[Gamma@localhost InputFiles]$ /usr/local/llvm/3.1.test/cpu0/1/cmake_debug_build/

</div>
<p>Currently we just define target td files (Cpu0.td, Cpu0RegisterInfo.td, ...).
According to LLVM structure, we need to define our target machine and include
those td related files.
The error message say we didn&#8217;t define our target machine.</p>
